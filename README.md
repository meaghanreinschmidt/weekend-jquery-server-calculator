# Weekend Challenge: Server Side Calculator

## Description

Duration: 1 Week

This project contains a functional calculator where the user can input two values and a mathematical operator. When the `=` button is clicked, the outcome of the operation is sent to the server via a POST. The `C` button serves to clear the input field similar to a basic calculator. The server handles the mathematical operator functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). A GET request holds the historical record of all previous operations and solutions on the server. Restarting the server will clear the history.
