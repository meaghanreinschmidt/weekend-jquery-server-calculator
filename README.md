# Weekend Challenge: Server Side Calculator

## Description

Duration: 1 Week

This project contains a functional calculator where the user can input two values and a mathematical operator. 
When the `=` button is clicked, the outcome of the operation is displayed on the client. 
The `C` button serves to clear the input field similar to a basic calculator. 
The server handles the mathematical operator functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

(There is a bit of commented out code on both the HTML and CSS files that were there for the stretch goal attempt to make the page look more like a calculator. 
These will stay in the final project so that the stretch goal may be attempted in the future.)
