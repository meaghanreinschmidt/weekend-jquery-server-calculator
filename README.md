# Weekend Challenge: Server Side Calculator

## Description

Duration: 1 Week

This project contains a functional calculator where the user can input two values and a mathematical operator. When the `=` button is clicked, the outcome of the operation is sent to the server via a POST. The `C` button serves to clear the input field similar to a basic calculator. The server handles the mathematical operator functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). A GET request holds the historical record of all previous operations and solutions on the server. Restarting the server will clear the history. 

You will notice that there is a file titled oldclient.js. This file is intended for the stretch goal to make the app look more like a real-life calculator. There is a bit of commented out code on both the HTML and CSS files that were there for the original project. These will stay in the final project so that the stretch goal may be attempted in the future.
