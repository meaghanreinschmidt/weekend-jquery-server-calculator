# Weekend Challenge: Server Side Calculator

## Description

*Duration: 1 Week*

This project contains a functional calculator where the user can input two values and a mathematical operator. 
When the `=` button is clicked, the outcome of the operation is displayed on the client. 
The `C` button serves to clear the input field similar to a basic calculator. 
The server handles the mathematical operator functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

(There is a bit of commented out code on both the HTML and CSS files that were there for the stretch goal attempt to make the page look more like a calculator. 
These will stay in the final project so that the stretch goal may be attempted in the future.)

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. Run `npm install` in your terminal
2. Run `npm start` in your terminal
3. Navigate to `localhost:5000` in browser (change port number if necessary)

## Usage

1. As a user, I want to be able to enter a number into the first input field, click a mathematical operator, and enter another number into the second input field. 
2. As a user, I want to click the `=` and have the solution of the mathematical operations display on the page.
3. As a user, I want to be able to see the history of my operations so I know which operations I have done previously.
4. As a user, I want to be able to clear the input fields and operator in case I want to start over.
